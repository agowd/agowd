# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Adi!


## About Me

Hi! My name is Aditya, but you can call me Adi. I'm currently pursuing a BSE in bioengineering and computer science and an MSE in robotics at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm excited about leveraging deep learning to better understand human biological systems -- like neurotech!

## Current Work

I'm currently an undergraduate researcher at the Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics at UPenn working on applying network neuroscience to epilepsy.

## Looking to Work In

I'm seeking opportunities in machine learning engineering, data science, and software development where I can contribute to impactful projects while continuing to learn and grow.
